Attempting Markdown language
----------------------------------

I'm not really sure if this is what I'm supposed to be doing, but here we go. 

Time to try some of the syntax:

1. An ordered list of top places I enjoy visiting on the weekend:
    1. Carmel
    2. Sonoma
    3. San Francisco
2. An unordered list of movies I like:
    * The Princess Bride
    * Amelie
    * Monty Python's Holy Grail

I am working on improving [my website](http://encaustech.com/ "Encaustech"), where I showcase my paintings.


Some of my favorite encaustic artists are [Daniella Woolf] [1],
[Wendy Aiken] [2] and [Judy Stabile] [3].
