Trying out Markdown language
----------------------------------

I had started learning html, so it's a little weird to take a step back and use Markdown, but it's all good! 

Here's some practice with the syntax:

1. An ordered list of top places I enjoy visiting on the weekend:
    1. Carmel
    2. Sonoma
    3. San Francisco
2. An unordered list of movies I like:
    * The Princess Bride
    * Amelie
    * Monty Python's Holy Grail

I am working on improving [my website](http://encaustech.com/ "Encaustech"), where I showcase my paintings.


Some of my favorite encaustic artists are [Daniella Woolf] [1],
[Wendy Aiken] [2] and [Judy Stabile] [3].

Encaustic painting uses a medium of heated beeswax and resin, to which colored pigments are added.
